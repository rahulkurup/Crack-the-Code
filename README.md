1) LinkedList Creation & Traversal

2) Delete a node in Linkedlist

3) Middle of a LinkedList (Efficiently)

4) Reverse a LinkedList (Recursive)

5) Print a random number in a LinkedList

6) Reverse a stack using recursion
You are not allowed to use loop constructs like while, for..etc, and you can only use the following ADT functions on Stack S:
isEmpty(S)
